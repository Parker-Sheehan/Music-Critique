I want to create a web app aimed towards music producers. The idea is for it to be a website that allows users to submit their songs for feadback
users should have to rate other music before they can receive feadback their self
users should be able to...

- make an account
- review songs from others
- submit their own songs for review
- view some sort of ladder
- view other's profiles
- follow other users
- message other users
- view song profiles
- see about page
